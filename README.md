# Music Player

This project is a simple, responsive music player built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player features controls for playing, pausing, skipping tracks, and adjusting the progress of the song. It's designed with a clean and modern interface, making it easy to use and visually appealing.

## Features

- **Play/Pause Control:** Start and stop the music with a single button.
- **Skip Tracks:** Navigate through tracks using previous and next buttons.
- **Progress Bar:** View and control the current playback position.
- **Responsive Design:** The music player is fully responsive and works on all device sizes.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main structure of the music player.
- `style.css`: Contains all the styling and layout for the music player.
- `script.js`: Handles the interactive features of the player, such as play/pause and progress tracking.

## Getting Started

To run this project, simply clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser.

```bash

## Usage

1. **Play/Pause**: Click the play button to start the music. The button will change to a pause icon, allowing you to pause the music.
